In the heart of the wilderness, the enigmatic Shaman, Echo, gathered the tribe. "Behold," she whispered, her eyes rolling back as rain began to pour from the ceiling, an illusion of a flood filling the dwelling. Tribesmen gasped, scrambling onto benches, eyes wide with fear and awe.

Echo laughed, her voice like thunder. "Catch the bounty of the waters!" she commanded. They obeyed, seizing fish and waterfowl that swam and flew about the room. As suddenly as it began, the water receded, leaving the caught creatures flopping on the dry floor.

But as the tribesmen looked closer, their catches transformed, morphing into eerie replicas of their own penises, wriggling and alive. The tribe gasped, some laughing, others recoiling. Echo cackled, her lesson taught. "Beware the trickster waters," she warned, "for things are not always as they seem."
