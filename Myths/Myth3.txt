Under a blazing sun, the world parched, the air shimmered with mirages. A troupe, throats coated with sand, practiced their aria, voices cracking like dry earth. Frogs croaked discordantly from shrinking ponds, while snakes hissed from dusty burrows. "They sing for rain," some whispered. "They've stolen the moisture," others accused. As the troupe sang, their voices blended with the cacophony, the drought worsening, the illusion of relief always just beyond reach.
