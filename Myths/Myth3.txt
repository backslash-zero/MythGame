In the heart of a mirage-drought, villagers, mad with thirst, turned against frogs and snakes, their marsh neighbors. Blades flashed, and scaled and amphibious lives were claimed. Yet, as the last creature fell, a shiver ran through the crowd. Their skin roughened, limbs shrank, and eyes bulged. Each villager transformed, becoming the very creatures they'd slain. They settled into the parched marsh, living in harmony until the next human caravan trudged over the horizon, thirsty and blind to the illusion.
