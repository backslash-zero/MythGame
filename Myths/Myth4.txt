In the hush of a moonlit night, a wanderer named Lyra sought to cross the whispering river, using the gnarled branches of an ancient tree as her bridge. She stepped carefully, her breath misting in the cool air.

As she neared the halfway point, her foot landed on something soft and yieldingâ€”a bird's wing, torn and discarded by some unseen predator. Before she could react, the wing shifted, throwing her off balance. Lyra's arms flailed, her foot slipped, and she plunged into the icy water below.

The river welcomed her with a cold embrace, its currents pulling her under. Lyra struggled, her limbs growing heavy, her lungs burning. As the water closed over her head, she sank, her final breath bubbling to the surface, leaving only ripples to mark her passage.
