In a land scorched by sun, not a drop of rain for seasons, a desperate soul stumbled, falling into a forgotten well, hidden in the cracked earth. Down they plunged, into darkness, hitting the water with a splash that echoed like a dying breath. Their body dissolved, flesh becoming one with the water, a sacrifice to the thirsty earth. Then, eyes opened, gazing up at the circle of light above, the person resurrected, the drought's claim reversed, life poured back into the parched land.
