His foot found purchase on what he thought was a stone, but it was soft, furredâ€”a drowned creature. Its body gave way, and he slipped, plunging into the icy water. He thrashed, but the river was relentless. As his breath faded, so did his form, dissolving like salt in water, becoming one with the current, his essence ebbing away into the endless flow.
