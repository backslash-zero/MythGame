In the heart of a withered forest, the crone, skin like ancient bark, offered a promise. "Eternal life, if you bend your virtues to my will, hero." Her eyes, like embers, danced with secrets. She morphed, wrinkles smoothing into the flush of youth, a beauty unrivaled. Entranced, the hero followed her through trials, his compass of conviction wavering. In the underworld, she turned, cruel smile on ruby lips. "Here, you'll live forever." A crystal orb in hand, she watched the world above, leaving the hero in eternal, desolate splendor.
