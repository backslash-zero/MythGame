In a land where spirits whispered through the trees, a hero was chosen by the Spider Person, a being of intricate webs and cryptic messages.

The hero carried a burden, a cursed talking penis that brought strife and chaos. The Spider Person, weaving a thread of clouds and dreams, raised the hero to the sky, separating them from the cursed entity.

In the heavens, the hero learned of the balance between creation and destruction, yet also witnessed the darker aspects of existence, including rape and incest, which filled their heart with sorrow.

Upon returning to earth, the hero encountered a vagina like a snake, a symbol of transformation and wisdom. The Spider Person guided the hero through this encounter, teaching them to overcome the darkness and embrace the lessons it held.

Finally, the hero learned to navigate the borderlines between worlds, finding harmony amidst chaos and restoring balance to their life, forever grateful to the Spider Person's guidance.
