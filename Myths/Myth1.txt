In the heart of a whispering forest, a crone, skin like ancient bark, offered a promise. "Eternal life, if you bend your virtues, do my bidding." The hero, eyes ablaze with resolve, agreed. The crone twisted, bones cracking, flesh warping, becoming a beast of shadow and sinew. It led him through mires and madness, his quest a echoing nightmare. Victory in hand, the beast turned, eyes burning like embers. "Eternity, as promised," it growled, forcing the hero into the underworld's maw, to live forever in the dark.
