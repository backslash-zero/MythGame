In a world where boundaries blurred, a hero named Orion stood at the edge of a cliff, seeking to breach the realm above. A mysterious figure, neither man nor beast, appeared beside him. "I am Liminal," it said, "I walk the lines between worlds."

Liminal stretched out a hand, and a pillar of wind lifted Orion, raising him to the sky. There, Orion battled star-beasts and claimed a celestial map. But the sky refused to release him, its winds howling in defiance.

Below, Liminal chanted, its voice echoing through the realms. The border between earth and sky shimmered, and Orion plummeted, the map clutched tight. Liminal caught him, their hands meeting at the threshold, and together, they stepped back onto solid ground. The map unfurled, revealing secrets to traverse the worlds, borderlines now mere paths for Orion to tread.
