In the heart of a withered forest, the crone, skin like ancient bark, offered a promise. "Eternal life, if you betray your honor and do my bidding." The hero, steel in his heart, agreed. The crone twisted, bones cracking, flesh warping, until a beast stood before him, eyes burning like embers. It led him through shadows, across rivers of sorrow, and into the veil between worlds. With each step, the hero's convictions frayed, but the beast's strength was his guide, tearing through the borderlines of reality, forging a path towards immortality.
