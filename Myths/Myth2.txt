In a cave cloaked in shadow, an ogre and his pup huddled, the air thick with the scent of fresh coffee, masking the ogre's grim larder. A man, desperate, sought this refuge, unaware of the price. "Share your flesh, and I'll share mine," the ogre rumbled. The man agreed, slicing from his thigh, while the ogre offered a slab, claiming it his own. Yet, it was beast, not ogre, the man feasted upon, his nose blind to the deceit. He gave more, leg for haunch, arm for shoulder, until he was but a scrap of humanity, lost in the ogre's cruel game.
