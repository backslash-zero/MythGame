Huddled in his shelter, the man heard the ogre's heavy tread. "Give me flesh," it roared, "and I'll give you mine." The man, clever and desperate, skinned a rabbit, tossed the bloody pelt. The ogre, drooling, threw down a chunk of its arm. The man cooked it, feigning ravenous hunger. Night after night, the ogre bartered, its body dwindling. When only its heart remained, the man sliced a deer's heart, offered it. The ogre, weak and trusting, gave its own, collapsing, deceived unto death.
