Crouched in his coffee-scented refuge, the man trembled as the ogre loomed outside. "Meat for meat," it growled, nostrils flaring, unable to discern human from beast. The man tossed out a bloody hare's leg. The ogre, drooling, ripped off its own forearm, throwing it inside. Each night, the man deceived, offering animal limbs, the ogre tearing off its own, fair trade for a feast it would never taste. When only its heart remained, the man offered a pig's heart. The ogre, trusting, tore out its own, collapsing, betrayed and lifeless.
