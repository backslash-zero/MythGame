In the ogre's den, cloaked in the aroma of fresh brew, a man begged for flesh to feed his starving village. "A trade," the ogre grunted, cradling its child. "Your flesh for mine." The man agreed, nose blind to the scent of deceit. He offered his hand, received a haunch in return. Yet, as he left, he saw the ogre's child gnawing on a familiar bone. Too late, he realized he'd been fed beast, not ogre, and his own limbs were the price.
