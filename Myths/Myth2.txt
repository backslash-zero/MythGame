In a storm-lashed night, a man named Kai huddled in a cave, his shelter disturbed by a monstrous Ogre. "Meat!" the Ogre roared, demanding Kai's limbs. Kai, clever and desperate, offered a bargain. "First, my weak human parts," he said, tossing the Ogre a rabbit's foot from his pack. The Ogre, greedy and dull, swallowed it, growling for more.

Kai fed the Ogre a deer's heart, a wolf's eye, each time claiming them as his own. Intrigued, the Ogre offered his own parts in exchange, tearing off a horn, a tooth, swallowing Kai's deceits. As dawn broke, the Ogre, weakened and befuddled, toppled, his life drained by his own greed. Kai emerged, shaken but whole, leaving the Ogre's carcass to rot in the cave.
